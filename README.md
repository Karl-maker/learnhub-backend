### `src/`

The `src/` directory contains the source code for LearnHub-Backend. This is where you'll find the implementation of the server-side logic, APIs, and other backend components.

### `docs/`

The `docs/` directory is dedicated to documentation. It is further organized into subdirectories:

- **`architecture.md`**: Provides a high-level overview of the project's architecture.

- **`api/`**: Contains API-related documentation.

  - **`endpoints.md`**: Details about different API endpoints.

  - **`authentication.md`**: Information about authentication mechanisms.

- **`guides/`**: Houses guides and tutorials.

  - **`installation.md`**: Instructions on installing the project.

  - **`configuration.md`**: Guide on configuring the project.

### `tests/`

The `tests/` directory is intended for storing test files or test-related resources. This is where you can organize your unit tests, integration tests, or any other testing-related materials.

### `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore` file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. This helps in keeping version control clean by excluding files like build artifacts or environment-specific configurations.

### `package.json`

The `package.json` file is the configuration file for npm and Yarn. It lists project dependencies and defines various scripts, including the development script (`dev`).

### `README.md`

The `README.md` is the main documentation file that provides an overview of the project. It includes information on how to install dependencies, run the project, contribute, and any other relevant details.
