# MVC Architecture in TypeScript Express

## Model-View-Controller (MVC) Overview

MVC is a software design pattern commonly used for organizing code in web applications. It divides the application into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It interacts with the database or external data sources and notifies observers (controllers and views) about changes.

- **View**: Presents data to the user. In web applications, views are often implemented as templates or components responsible for rendering the user interface.

- **Controller**: Handles user input, processes requests, interacts with the model to retrieve or update data, and selects views for presentation.

## Folder Structure

### `src/controllers/`

This folder contains controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests. Controllers interact with models to retrieve or update data and determine which views to render.

### `src/models/`

The `models` folder hosts the data models and business logic. Models represent entities, manage data access, and notify controllers and views about changes.

### `src/views/`

Views, located in the `views` folder, present data to the user. They can be templates or components responsible for rendering the user interface.

### `src/routes/`

The `routes` folder defines the routes for the application, mapping URLs to controllers and actions. It acts as a bridge between the HTTP layer and the controllers.

### `src/services/`

Services in the `services` folder encapsulate non-trivial business logic that doesn't belong in controllers or models. Common tasks like authentication, sending emails, etc., can be implemented here.

### `src/middlewares/`

Middlewares, found in the `middlewares` folder, are functions with access to the request and response objects. They can perform operations before or after the main logic of the controller.

### `src/public/`

Static assets, such as stylesheets, images, and client-side scripts, reside in the `public` folder. These assets are served directly to the client.

### `src/main/server.ts`

The `server.ts` file initializes the Express server, sets up middleware, defines routes, and connects controllers to routes.

### `src/app.ts`

The `app.ts` file serves as the entry point for the application. It may configure global settings, initialize the server, and set up any necessary middleware.

### `tsconfig.json`

The TypeScript configuration file specifies compiler options and settings for the project.

## Conclusion

The MVC architecture and associated folder structure provide a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and maintain web applications. Controllers handle user input, models manage data and business logic, and views present information to users, fostering a modular and scalable codebase.
